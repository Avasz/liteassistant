> **⚠️ VIBECODED APPLICATION**
> This application was "vibecoded" (generated by AI) and is intended for experimental use. It performs a specific subset of home automation tasks, primarily controlling Tasmota switches via MQTT.
> **Use at your own risk.** Ensure you trust the code and the environment before deploying.

LiteAssistant is a lightweight home automation dashboard designed to control and monitor Tasmota devices. It provides a clean, modern interface for managing switches, schedules, automations, and notifications.

## Features

*   **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically discovers Tasmota devices on your MQTT broker.
*   **Device Control**: Toggle switches, view sensor data, and manage device settings.
*   **Schedules**: Create flexible schedules (Once, Daily, Weekly, Interval) for your devices.
    *   *Interval Schedules*: Run devices periodically (e.g., turn on for 10 seconds every 5 minutes).
*   **Automations**: Create simple "If This Then That" rules based on device states or sensor values.
*   **Notifications**: Get notified via Telegram or Ntfy when events occur.
*   **Dashboard**: customizable dashboard to view your most important devices.
*   **Profile Management**: Update your username and password.

## Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.9+**
*   **Node.js 16+** (for building frontend)
*   **PostgreSQL** (or SQLite for testing)
*   **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto)
*   **Tasmota Devices** (configured to use the MQTT broker)
